// found or `timeout_ms` elapses (0 = no timeout). Returns true on match.
//
// `name_filter`, when non-empty, is matched as a substring against the
// advertised Complete / Short Local Name. The filter can hold multiple
// substrings separated by '|' (with optional surrounding whitespace), and
// any one matching accepts the ad — useful when an app and its bootloader
// advertise under different names.
//
// `min_rssi` rejects ads weaker than the threshold (in dBm, negative). Pass
// -127 for no signal-strength filter.
//
// `prefer_mac`, when non-null, makes the scanner additionally accept ads
// whose MAC equals `*prefer_mac` or `*prefer_mac + 1` (Nordic convention
// for the app→bootloader transition). The name filter still applies on top
// — matching either side accepts the ad. Used right after a buttonless
// trigger so we don't lose the target when the bootloader advertises under
// a different name.
